				If you have a component and one Engineering BOM related to it you will have engineering bom lines come from client and other lines that you can add manually.
            	<p>
            	When you go to create a new revision of that component the new engineering BOM is created with new updates.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	All BOM lines added by you in the previous revision are copied in the new BOM lines.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	So in the revised product you will find your new updated BOM linked.
